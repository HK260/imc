# IMC Prosperity 2.0 - Trading Algorithm Competition

## Introduction

IMC Prosperity 2.0 is a project developed for the IMC Prosperity trading algorithm competition organized by IMC Trading. This competition focuses on developing and testing algorithmic trading strategies. Participants create algorithms that can trade financial products efficiently and profitably. The competition provides a backtesting environment, where participants can test their algorithms using historical data before submitting them for evaluation in real trading scenarios.

## Competition Overview

The IMC Prosperity competition involves teams from universities and other institutions developing strategies that are evaluated based on their performance. The goal is to optimize trading algorithms to achieve the highest profitability while adhering to trading limits and other constraints set by the competition.

### Key Features:
- **Backtesting Environment:** Test algorithms using historical data.
- **Data Provided:** Prices and anonymized trade data for various financial products.
- **Evaluation:** Strategies are evaluated based on performance, focusing on profitability and adherence to trading limits.
